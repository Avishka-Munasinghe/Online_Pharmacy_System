# Online Pharmacy System

The Online Pharmacy System is a robust and user-friendly web application that facilitates the seamless purchase of medicines online. Leveraging the power of Java for backend functionality, CSS and SASS for stylish and responsive design, and JavaScript for interactive user interfaces, this project was done by me and my colleagues for a module called Object-oriented Programming in 2nd-year at the university.
